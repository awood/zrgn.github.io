# ZargCon

ZargCon is an annual weekend of gaming: board, video, roleplaying, and otherwise. It began with a small group in 2015. ZargCon is a volunteer effort and our fees are always intended to cover our bare minimum expenses.

## When is it?

7â€”8 December 2019 from 9 a.m to 9 p.m. both days.

## Where is it?

In 2019, we are being hosted by the [Red Hat Tower
Annex](https://goo.gl/maps/1xa2pdhQokqDxsq57).

* Drinks and snacks provided by Red Hat will not be available to our attendees

As long as you're cool with them and you think they won't be jerks, sure! They'll still have to pay however. We will also need a list names for any of your guests.

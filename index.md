## Bylaws

### Objectives
Good humored, cooperative, competitive, consensual torture, for the purposes of
exploring strategies, design, progress and history of gaming

### Members
* You may invite new members to join in gaming, but they are your responsibility
* New invitees should come to provisional games (e.g., Friday games) for the
  sake of the invitee and the group
* If the group at large does not like a guest then that guest may not be allowed
  at future events
* Players are expected to maintain basic personal hygiene
* Guests are expected to be gracious and respect additional restrictions of
  venue (e.g. no smoking inside; no young children; allergy considerations)

### Games
* Exhibit good sportsmanship. Be gracious in both victory and defeat
* Players shall play to the best of their abilities (and not for the purpose of
  antagonizing or targeting others)
* Cheating is prohibited and viewed as a grievous violation of the Spirit of
  Zargon
* If after a few initial explanations of a game's rule, a player requires
  continual clarification, that player may be expected to abstain from the game
  until he or she can master the rules outside of gaming sessions.  Watching
  video tutorials, private study, or explicit "learning games" are the onus of
  the individual, not the group
* Treat game components with respect and care, especially if it is not your game
* Players shall not repeatedly gripe, grouse, whinge, or whine about the design
  of a game.  Players are expected to have the self-awareness to abstain from
  games that they dislike
* Players seeking to make improvements to a game should offer suggestions
  constructively by making concrete proposals for house rules

### Infractions
* It is incumbent on players to bring issues to the attention of the general 
  group.  An issue can't be addressed if no one else is aware it exists.  Either 
  bring up the issue directly with the other player or speak to some of the 
  other members that you are close with.  If they agree that it's an issue that 
  needs addressing, the matter should be brought to a group as a whole for discussion.

### Sanctions
* Apologize when appropriate
* Ameliorate the situation (e.g. repair or replace a damaged game; buy person a
  lunch to mend things)

Continued violations may result in ejection from the group, by process of
consensus of active and long-standing members.

### Code of Conduct

#### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to
making participation in our community a consent based, harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

#### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

### Objectives

Good humored, cooperative, competitive, consensual torture, for the purposes of exploring strategies, design, progress and history of gaming

### Members

* You may invite new members to join in gaming, but they are your responsibility
* New invitees should come to provisional games (e.g., Friday games) for the sake of the invitee and the group
* If the group at large does not like a guest then that guest may not be allowed at future events

### Games

* If after more than two explanations, and video tutorial, you require continued clarification a particular game, perhaps it's not the game for you
* Treat game components with respect and care, especially if it is not your game
* If a game seems "broken"/"designed poorly"/"terrible", more over consistently so, and by continued review it appears to just be only you experiencing this, maybe that game isn't for you
* If you feel the need to continue complaining about a particular game then you must provide a viable alternative, cease complaining, or consider sitting out that day
* Players are expected play to the best of their abilities (not to piss off or target others)

### Sanctions

* Apologize when appropriate
* Ameliorate the situation (e.g., pay for damaged game; buy person a lunch)

Continued violations may result in ejection from the group, by process of consensus of active and long standing members.

# Zargon

## Bylaws

### Objectives
Good humored, cooperative, competitive, consensual torture, for the purposes of
exploring strategies, design, progress and history of gaming

### Members
* There is no single leader of the Zargon community. Zargon is a community run
  effort. All members are encouraged to participate in this effort.
* You may invite new members to join in gaming, but they are your
  responsibility.
* New invitees should come to provisional games (e.g., Friday games, or similar
  virtual games) for the sake of the invitee and the community.
* If community members at large do not like a guest then that guest may not be
  invited to future events.
* Members are expected to maintain basic personal hygiene.
* Members are expected to be gracious and respect additional restrictions of
  venue (e.g. no smoking inside; no young children; allergy considerations).

### Games
* Exhibit good sportsmanship. Be gracious in both victory and defeat.
* Members shall play to the best of their abilities (and not for the purpose of
  antagonizing or targeting others).
* Cheating is prohibited and viewed as a grievous violation of the Spirit of
  Zargon.
* If after a few initial explanations of a game's rule, a member requires
  continual clarification, that member may be expected to abstain from the game
  until they can master the rules outside of a gaming sessions. Watching video
  tutorials, private study, or explicit "learning games" are the onus of the
  individual, not the community.
* Treat game components with respect and care, especially if it is not your
  game.
* Members shall not repeatedly gripe, grouse, whinge, or whine about the design
  of a game. Members are expected to have the self-awareness to abstain from
  games that they dislike.
* Members seeking to make improvements to a game should offer suggestions
  constructively by making concrete proposals for house rules.

### Infractions
It is incumbent on members to bring issues to the attention of the community.
An issue can't be addressed if no one else is aware it exists. Either bring up
the issue directly with the other member or speak to some of the other members
that you are close with. If they agree that it's an issue that needs
addressing, the matter should be brought to the community as a whole for
discussion.

### Sanctions
* Apologize when appropriate
* Ameliorate the situation (e.g. repair or replace a damaged game; buy person a
  lunch to mend things)

Continued violations may result in ejection from the community, by process of
consensus of active and long-standing members.

### Code of Conduct

#### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to
make participation in our community a consent based, harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

#### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by members include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Members asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

#### Thanks
